# LightRasterWindow
Light multimedia library with pixel access screen space, spritesheet loading and rendering and wav audio files player. 
Created with mind of prototyping small games projects.


############   What LRW can:   ############
-Create a window (also fullscreen)
-Load spritesheet
-Render spritesheet
-Cut and render sprite from spritesheet at given size and position
-Handle keyboard and mouse input
-(Work in progress)Play wav files


############  How to use it after I created project with LRW ?  ############
1.See file FirstWindow.java in demos folder. This is how most project will be initialized.
2.Next is Rendering_Sprites.java where is presented how to load and render sprites
3.Last demo is Playing_Sound.java where is showed how to load and play wav filea and also
how to use Graphics Runnable for rendering text.


Thats all knowledge you need to start prototyping with LRW library.

TODO:
-Write more about LRW rendering, z_buffer, update runnable
