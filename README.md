# LightRasterWindow
Light multimedia library with pixel access screen space, spritesheet loading and rendering and wav audio files player. 
Created with mind of prototyping small (pixelart)games projects.

</br></br>
############   What LRW can:   ############</br>
-Create a window (also fullscreen)</br>
-Load spritesheet</br>
-Render spritesheet</br>
-Cut and render sprite from spritesheet at given size and position</br>
-Handle keyboard and mouse input</br>
-(Work in progress)Play wav files</br>

</br></br>
############  How to use it after I created project with LRW ?  ############</br>
1.See file FirstWindow.java in demos folder. This is how most project will be initialized.</br>
2.Next is Rendering_Sprites.java where is presented how to load and render sprites</br>
3.Last demo is Playing_Sound.java where is showed how to load and play wav filea and also</br>
how to use Graphics Runnable for rendering text.</br>
</br></br>

Thats all knowledge you need to start prototyping with LRW library.</br></br>

TODO:</br>
-Write more about LRW rendering, z_buffer, update runnable
